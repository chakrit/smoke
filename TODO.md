# TODO

* [ ] Make whitelist/blacklist code generic so it works on multiple specs/types/results
  etc.
* [ ] HTTP checks to allow testing APIs/webpages
* [ ] Allow partially committing some results but not all
* [ ] Allow committing last run results (so we don't have to re-run tests to commit again)
* [ ] Read tests from stdin to support getting tests from other toolings (like cue)
      Not sure how lock file would work in this case though.
